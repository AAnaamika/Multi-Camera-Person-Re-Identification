# Multi-Camera Person Re-Identification

This repository is inspired by the paper [Spatial-Temporal Reidentification (ST-ReID)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03282.pdf)[1]. The state-of-the-art for Person Re-identification tasks.

This repository has been trained & tested on DukeMTMTC-reID and Market-1501 datasets. The model can be easily trained on any new datasets.

Below are the metrics on the various datasets.
